Slider was a [submission](https://randomerz.itch.io/slider-jam) to GMTK 2021. The game placed 16th by community at the end! Spring 2022, I pitched the game to Georgia Tech's Video Game Dev club, and we developed the game over the next three years.

In April 2022, the game was released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1916890/Slider/) and in July we published a demo version of Slider.

Finally after long years in development, v1.0 was released on Steam on July 24, 2024.
